[[exported-fields]]
== Exported fields

This document describes the fields that are exported by the
topbeat. They are grouped in the
following categories:

* <<exported-fields-env>>
* <<exported-fields-system>>
* <<exported-fields-process>>
* <<exported-fields-filesystem>>

[[exported-fields-env]]
=== Common fields fields

Contains common fields available in all event types.



==== timestamp

type: date

example: 2015-01-24 14:06:05.071000

format: YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.milliZ

required: True

The timestamp when the measurements were taken. The precision is in milliseconds. The timezone is UTC.


==== type

required: True

Set to "system" to specify that are system wide statistics.


==== count

type: int

required: True

For how many transactions is this event representative. This is generally the inverse of the sampling rate. For example, for a sample rate of 1/10, the count is 10. The count is used by the UIs to return estimated values. Reserved for future usage.


==== shipper

type: string

Name of the shipper sending the statistics


[[exported-fields-system]]
=== System wide statistics fields

Contains system wide statistics. Details that you can get by running the *top* command on Unix systems.



=== load fields

System load average. The load average is the average number  of jobs in the run queue.



==== load1

type: float

Load average over 1 minute. 


==== load5

type: float

Load average over 5 minutes.


==== load15

type: float

Load average over 15 minutes. 


=== cpu fields

This group contains statistics related to the CPU usage.


==== cpu.user

type: int

CPU time spent in user space 


==== cpu.user_p

type: float

CPU time spent in user space, in percentage. On multi-core systems, you can have percentages that are greater than 100%.  For example, if 3 cores are at 60% use, then the cpu.user_p will be 180%.


==== cpu.nice

type: int

CPU time spent on low priority processes


==== cpu.system

type: int

CPU time spent in kernel space


==== cpu.system_p

type: float

CPU time spent in kernel space, in percentage.


==== cpu.idle

type: int

CPU time spent idle


==== cpu.iowait

type: int

CPU time spent in wait (on disk)


==== cpu.irq

type: int

CPU time spent servicing/handling hardware interrupts


==== cpu.softirq

type: int

CPU time spent servicing/handling software interrupts

==== cpu.steal

type: int

CPU time in involuntary wait by virtual cpu while hypervisor is servicing another processor CPU time stolen from a virtual machine. Available only on Unix.

=== mem fields

This group contains statistics related to the memory usage on the system.


==== mem.total

type: int

Total memory


==== mem.used

type: int

Used memory


==== mem.free

type: int

Available memory


==== mem.used_p

type: float

Used memory, in percentage


==== mem.actual_used

type: int

Actual used memory. Available only on Unix.


==== mem.actual_free

type: int

Actual available memory. Available only on Unix.


=== swap fields

This group contains statistics related to the swap memory usage on the system.


==== swap.total

type: int

Total swap memory


==== swap.used

type: int

Used swap memory


==== swap.free

type: int

Available swap memory


==== swap.used_p

type: float

Used swap memory, in percentage


==== swap.actual_used

type: int

Actual used swap memory. Available only on Unix.


==== swap.actual_free

type: int

Actual available swap memory. Available only on Unix.


[[exported-fields-process]]
=== Per process statistics fields

Per process statistics that you can get by running the *top* or *ps* command on Unix systems.



=== proc fields

Contains per process statistics like memory usage, CPU usage and details about each process like state, name, pid, ppid.



==== proc.name

type: string

Process name.


==== proc.state

type: string

Process state. Example: "running"


==== proc.pid

type: int

Process pid.


==== proc.ppid

type: int

Process parent pid.


=== cpu fields

CPU specific statistics per process.


==== proc.cpu.user

type: int

CPU time spent in user space by the process.


==== proc.cpu.user_p

type: float

CPU time spent in user space by the process, in percentage.


==== proc.cpu.system

type: int

CPU time spent in kernel space by the process.


==== proc.cpu.total

type: int

Total CPU time spent by the process.


==== proc.cpu.start_time

type: string

Time when the process was started. Example: "17:45".


=== mem fields

Memory specific statistics per process.


==== proc.mem.size

type: int

Virtual memory the process has in total.


==== proc.mem.rss

type: int

Resident Set Size. Memory occupied by the process in main memory(RAM).


==== proc.mem.rss_p

type: float

Memory occupied by the process in main memory(RAM), in percentage.


==== proc.mem.share

type: int

Shared memory the process uses.


[[exported-fields-filesystem]]
=== File system statistics fields

File system related statistics that you can get by using the *df* command on Unix systems.
