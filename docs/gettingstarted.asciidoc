== Getting started

Topbeat helps you monitor the availability of your website or service by providing system wide and per process
statistics together with disk space overview. This quick tutorial walks you through the installation steps of Topbeat:

 * Install Topbeat on your servers to capture system wide and per process statistics
 * Install Elasticsearch for storing the data
 * Install Kibana for visualizing the statistics from your servers

The installation guides for Elasticsearch and Kibana are available
https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/packetbeat/current/packetbeat-getting-started.html[here].

=== Topbeat installation


deb:

[source,shell]
------------------------------------------------
curl -L -O https://download.elasticsearch.org/beats/topbeat/topbeat_1.0.0-beta3_amd64.deb
sudo dpkg -i topbeat_1.0.0-beta3_amd64.deb
------------------------------------------------



rpm:

[source,shell]
------------------------------------------------
curl -L -O https://download.elasticsearch.org/beats/topbeat/topbeat-1.0.0-beta3-x86_64.rpm
sudo rpm -vi topbeat-1.0.0-beta3-x86_64.rpm
------------------------------------------------


mac:

[source,shell]
------------------------------------------------
curl -L -O https://download.elasticsearch.org/beats/topbeat/topbeat-1.0.0-beta3-darwin.tgz
tar xzvf topbeat-1.0.0-beta3-darwin.tgz
------------------------------------------------

NOTE: We also provide 32bits images. You can get them from our
https://www.elastic.co/downloads/beats/topbeat[download page].

Before starting topbeat, have a look at the configuration options from `/etc/topbeat/topbeat.yml`, 
described in the next chapter.

[[topbeat-configuration]]
=== Topbeat configuration

[source, shell]
-------------------------------------
input:
  period: 10
  procs: [".*"]
-------------------------------------

`period` defines how often to read system wide and per process statistics from your servers. The interval is in seconds. 
By default, it's set to 10 seconds.

`procs` defines a list of regular expressions to match all the processes that need to be monitored. By default, all the running processes are monitored.

If you are not interested in monitoring your processes, then you can use:

[source, shell]
-------------------------------------
input:
  period: 10
  procs: ["^$"]
-------------------------------------

Before starting topbeat, you need to load the
http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/indices-templates.html[index
template], which is used to let Elasticsearch know which fields should be analyzed
in which way.

The recommended template file is installed by the Topbeat packages. Load it with the
following command:

deb or rpm:

[source,shell]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
curl -XPUT 'http://localhost:9200/_template/topbeat' -d@/etc/topbeat/topbeat.template.json
----------------------------------------------------------------------

mac:

[source,shell]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
cd topbeat-$PB_VERSION-darwin
curl -XPUT 'http://localhost:9200/_template/topbeat' -d@topbeat.template.json
----------------------------------------------------------------------

where `localhost:9200` is the IP and port where Elasticsearch is listening on.

You are now ready to start topbeat:

deb:

[source,shell]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
sudo /etc/init.d/topbeat start
----------------------------------------------------------------------

rpm:

[source,shell]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
sudo /etc/init.d/topbeat start
----------------------------------------------------------------------

mac:

[source,shell]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
sudo ./topbeat -e -c topbeat.yml -d "publish"
----------------------------------------------------------------------


Check if your servers statistics are present in Elasticsearch:

[source,shell]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
curl -XGET 'http://localhost:9200/topbeat-*/_search?pretty'
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Make sure to replace `localhost:9200` with the address of your Elasticsearch
instance. 


=== Configure Kibana

After installing Kibana by following the
https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/packetbeat/current/packetbeat-getting-started.html[getting started guide], open
the Kibana web interface to get it started.

The first thing you need to do is to configure the index pattern. There are two ways you can 
configure the index patterns in Kibana:

 - Automatically by loading dashboards, visualizations, seacrhes and index patterns. The steps 
    are described in the next chapter.

 - Manually by configuring the [packetbeat-]YYYY.MM.DD index pattern under the `Settings`->`Indices` page.

==== Configure manually index pattern in Kibana

Enable `Use event times to create index names` in order to create the index based
on the events already available in Elasticsearch. 
The index pattern for Packetbeat contains a date format as an index is created daily: 
`[topbeat-]YYYY.MM.DD`

image:./images/kibana-topbeat-index-pattern.png[Kibana index pattern]

If an error like `_Unable to fetch mapping` persists even after you configure the 
`[topbeat-]YYYY.MMDD` index pattern check if you have indices matching the pattern. 
If not, it means that Packetbeat hasn't yet written any data into Elasticsearch. Make sure that
some traffic was running on your servers and that Packetbeat could see it.

If everything goes fine, you should already see in real-time statistics reported by
Topbeat under the `Discover` page:

image:./images/kibana-topbeat-discover.png[Topbeat Discover page in Kibana]

==== System wide overview

You can configure the `Dashboard` page to show the statistics that you are interested in for all the servers or for a
subset of them.
An example of a dashboard page can consist of CPU usage and memory consumption for the top 10 CPU consuming processes
running on different servers, free and used disk space for all servers, the CPU usage per processes, memory consumption per processes.

image:./images/topbeat-dashboard-example.png[Topbeat Dashboard page in Kibana]

==== Per server overview

To display the statistics coming from a single server, a search query like *shipper: precise32* can be used:

image:./images/topbeat-dashboard-1shipper.png[Topbeat Dashboard page in Kibana for one server]

You can learn more about Kibana in the
http://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/current/index.html[Kibana User Guide].


=== Sample Kibana dashboards

Kibana has a large set of visualization types which you can combine to create
the perfect dashboards for your needs. But this flexibility can be a bit
overwhelming at the beginning, so we have created a couple of
<<sample-dashboards,sample dashboards>> to give you a good start and to
demonstrate what is possible based on the packet data.

To load the dashboards, visualizations, searches and create the index patterns follow the steps from the 
https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/packetbeat/current/packetbeat-getting-started.html#_sample_kibana_dashboards[Load
Dashboards Section]

Enjoy!
