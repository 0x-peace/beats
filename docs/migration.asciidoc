== Logtash-Forwarder to Filebeat Migration

The following guide should help you to upgrade from the
https://github.com/elastic/logstash-forwarder[Logstash-Forwarder] to Filebeat.

Filebeat brings the following major changes:

* The config file was restructured and converted from json to yaml
* The registry file which stores the state of the currently read files was changed
* Command line options were removed and moved to the confg file
* Configuration options for outputs are inherited from libbeat. Details can be found https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/libbeat/current/index.html[here]

Here is a simple example how a simple config from logstash-forwarder can be migrated to filebeat:

=== logstash-forwarder.json
[source,json]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
{
  "files": [
    {
      "paths": [
        "/var/log/*.log"
      ],
      "fields": { "type": "syslog" }
    }
  ],
  "network": {
    "servers": [ "localhost:5043" ],
  }
}
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

=== filebeat.yml
[source,yaml]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
filebeat:
  prospectors:
    -
      paths:
        - /var/log/*.log
    fields:
      type: syslog
output:
  elasticsearch:
    enabled: true
    hosts: ["http://localhost:5043"]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

=== Migrate your configuration

Logstash-Forwarder uses JSON + comments for its configuration file while
Filebeat uses YaML for consistency with the other Beats. Like the
Logstash-Forwarder, Filebeat also accepts reading multiple configuration files
from a `conf.d` directory with similar restrictions. So the conversion can be
done in most cases 1 to 1.

We recommend to first read the <<filebeat-configuration-details>> section which
documents the Filebeat options.


NOTE:: Logstash-Forwarder has the option of auto-completing environment variables in
the configuration file. This option currently doesn't exist in Filebeat.

==== The "files" section

The "files" section from the Logstash-Forwarder configuration is transformed in
a "prospectors" section in the Filebeat config. For example, assuming you start
with this configuration:

[source,json]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  # The list of files configurations
  "files": [
    # An array of hashes. Each hash tells what paths to watch and
    # what fields to annotate on events from those paths.
    {
      "paths": [
        "/var/log/messages",
        "/var/log/*.log"
      ],

      # A dictionary of fields to annotate on each event.
      "fields": { "type": "syslog" }
    }, {
      # A path of "-" means stdin.
      "paths": [ "-" ],
      "fields": { "type": "stdin" }
    }, {
      "paths": [
        "/var/log/apache/httpd-*.log"
      ],
      "fields": { "type": "apache" }
    }
  ]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The equivalent "prospectors" section would look like this:

[source,yaml]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
filebeat:
  # List of prospectors to fetch data.
  prospectors:
    # Each - is a prospector. Below are the prospector specific configurations
    -
      paths:
        - /var/log/messages
        - /var/log/*.log
    -
      paths:
        - "-"
      type: stdin <1>
      fields:
        type: stdin
    -
      paths:
        - /var/log/apache/httpd-*.log
      fields:
        type: apache
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<1> The explicit type field was introduced to separate between normal files and
    stdin. In the future, more types might be supported.

As you can see, apart from the new optional `type` field which was introduced,
the rest of the options can be migrated mechanically.

The Filebeat configuration allows some of the options that are global in the
Logstash-Forwarder to be configured per prospector. See
<<filebeat-configuration-details>>.

==== The "network" section

Like the Logstash-Forwarder, Filebeat uses the Lumberjack protocol for
communicating with Logstash. In addition, Filebeat can also insert directly
into Elasticsearch, this is why the "output" configuration in the sample
Filebeat configuration little bit more complex. The Logstash part of it,
however, can be easily translated from the equivalent Logstash-Forwarder
configuration.

Assuming you start from the following "network" section:

[source,json]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  # The network section covers network configuration :)
  "network": {
    # A list of downstream servers listening for our messages.
    # logstash-forwarder will pick one at random and only switch if
    # the selected one appears to be dead or unresponsive
    "servers": [ "localhost:5043" ],

    # The path to your client ssl certificate (optional)
    "ssl certificate": "./logstash-forwarder.crt",
    # The path to your client ssl key (optional)
    "ssl key": "./logstash-forwarder.key",

    # The path to your trusted ssl CA file. This is used
    # to authenticate your downstream server.
    "ssl ca": "./logstash-forwarder.crt",

    # Network timeout in seconds. This is most important for
    # logstash-forwarder determining whether to stop waiting for an
    # acknowledgement from the downstream server. If an timeout is reached,
    # logstash-forwarder will assume the connection or server is bad and
    # will connect to a server chosen at random from the servers list.
    "timeout": 15
  }
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The equivalent in Filebeat would look like this:


[source,yaml]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
output:
  lumberjack:
    enabled: true

    # The list of downstream Logstash servers. <1>
    hosts:
      - localhost:5043

    tls: <2>
      # The path to your client ssl certificate
      certificate: ./logstash-forwarder.crt
      # The path to your client ssl key
      certificate-ssl: ./logstash-forwarder.key

      # The path to your trusted ssl CA file. This is used
      # to authenticate your downstream server.
      certificate-authorities:
        - ./logstash-forwarder.crt

      # Network timeout in seconds.
      timeout: 15
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<1> When multiple hosts are defined, the default behavior in Filebeat is to
    pick a random one for new connections, similar to the Logstash-Forwarder
    behavior. Filebeat can optionally also to load balancing, see
    {libbeat}/configuration.html#_loadbalance/[the configuration option].
<2> Note that if the `tls` section is missing the encryption is disabled. It's
   automatically enabled when adding the `tls` section. More TLS options are
   documented {libbeat}/configuration.html#configuration-output-tls[here].

==== Changed configuration file options

With the refactoring of the configuration file, some options were also removed or renamed. Below is a list with the changed entries:

[cols="2*", options="header"]
|===
|Config Option
|Action

|`deadTime`
|`deadTime` was renamed to `ignoreOlder`. In case a file is not changed for `ignoreOlder`, the file handler will be closed. If the file is changed again after ignoreOlder has passed, it is be reopened.

|`netTimeout`
|`netTimeout` was removed as it is replaced by the Timeout option in libbeat.

|`log-to-syslog` and `syslog`
|Both options were removed as logging is part of the libbeat config.

|===

=== Command Line Options

Most command line options from logstash-forwarder have been removed and
migrated to config file options. The only mandatory option for filebeat is `-c`
with the path to the config file to be loaded. In case you used command line
options with Logstash-Forwarder, make sure to add your options to the
configuration file. For the naming changes, check the list below.

The general concept for the config options is that all options are available as
part of the config file and only some special options are also available as
command line option.

==== Renamed options

The renamed command line options are listed below. Also check Config Options
below for options that were either completely removed or moved to libbeat.

[cols="3*", options="header"]
|===
|Command Line Option
|Config File Option
|Description

|`-config`
|`-c`
|The config options was split up in two part. The base and required config is linked with -c. Additional config files can be linked as part of the config file. Note: Additional config files must be in a different directory than the main config file.

|`-config`
|`config_dir`
|Path to directory with additional configuration files

|`-idle-timeout`
|`idle_timeout`
|`idle_timeout` was moved to the config file and removed as flag.

|`-spool-size`
|`spool_size`
|`spool_size` was moved to the config file and removed as flag.

|`-harvester-buff-size`
|`harvester_buffer_size`
|`harvester_buffer_size` was moved to the config file and removed as flag. It can now be configured specific for each harvester.

|`-tail`
|`tail_on_rotate`
|`tail_on_rotate` was moved to the config file and removed as flag. It can now be configured specific for each harvester.

|`-cpuProfileFile`
|
|`cpuProfileFile` option was removed. The profiling options of libbeat can be used instead. For more details on profiling see https://github.com/elastic/libbeat/issues/122

|`-quiet`
|
|The `quiet` option was removed. Libbeat is used for logging and the libbeat configuration options have to be used.


|===

==== Config Options
With the refactoring of the configuration file, some options were also removed or renamed. Below is a list with the changed entries:

[cols="2*", options="header"]
|===
|Config Option
|Action

|`deadTime`
|`deadTime` was renamed to `ignore_older`. In case a file is not changed for `ignore_older`, the file handler will be closed. If the file is changed again after ignore_older has passed, it is be reopened.

|`netTimeout`
|`netTimeout` was removed as it is replaced by the Timeout option in libbeat.

|`log-to-syslog` and `syslog`
|Both options were removed as logging is part of the libbeat config.

|===

==== Renamed config options
* DeadTime was renamed to ignore_older


===  Registry file

The registry file stores the state and location from which Filbeat was reading last. Under logstash-forwarder was called
`.logstash-fowarder`. For Filebeat it was renamed to `.filebeat`. For enhancements reasons, especially for Windows the
structure of the registry file has been changed. This makes a migration complex and leads to potential errors.

Instead of a migration we recommend to start Filebeat on the same host and send the log files to a different index.
This will start indexing from scratch. In case it is preferred to start at the end of all files, the option tail_on_rotate
can be set to true.

The above will allow to keep the old logstash-forwarder running and it can be slowly switched over to Filebeat.

=== New input plug-in for Logstash

TODO


=== Other changes

The following is a list of implementation changes that we don't expect to
affect your experience migrating from Logstash-Forwarder but that you should be
aware of. Please post GitHub issues if notice any regression from
Logstash-Forwarder.

==== Packaging

The packaging process for Filebeat uses the Beats infrastructure, so some
things like the init scripts are different from those that the
Logstash-Forwarder provided. Please post GitHub issues if you hit any issues
with the new packages.

==== Publisher improvements

Behind the scenes, Filebeat uses a sightly improved protocol for communicating
with Logstash.

==== Logging

Filebeat uses libbeat logging and can also log to a file instead of syslog.
