== Overview

Topbeat is a lightweight shipper that installed on your servers, reads periodically 
system wide and per process CPU and memory statistics and indexes them in Elasticsearch.

Topbeat helps you monitor your servers by collecting metrics like:

*System wide statistics*

    * System load: in the last minute, in the last 5 minutes and in the last 15 minutes
    * System wide CPU usage: user (and percentage), system, idle, IOWait, etc
    * System wide Memory usage: total, used (and percentage), free, etc
    * System wide Swap usage: total, used (and percentage), free, etc

*Per process statistics*

	* Process name
    * Process parent pid
    * Process state
    * Process pid
    * Process CPU usage: user (and percentage), system, total, start time
    * Process Memory usage: virtual memory, resident memory (and percentage), shared memory

*File system statistics*

    * List of the available disks
    * For each disk, exports name, type, where is mounted
    * For each disk, exports total, used (and percentage), free, available space


The shippers can insert the collected metrics directly into Elasticsearch
or via Logstash.
