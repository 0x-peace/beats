################### Filebeat Configuration Example #########################

############################# Filbeat ######################################
filebeat:
  # List of prospectors to fetch data
  prospectors:
    -
      # Paths that should be crawled and fetched
      paths:
        - /var/log/*.log

      # Type of the files. Based on this the way the file is read is decided. The different types cannot be mixed.
      #
      # Possible options are:
      # * log: Reads every line of the log file (default)
      # * file: Sends the full file on change. This replaces fsRiver
      # * meta: Reads new meta information on file change
      # * stdin: Reads the standard in
      type: log

      # Optional additional fields
      fields:
        level: debug
        review: 1

      # Ignore files which were modified more then the defined timespan in the past
      ignoreOlder:

      # Scan frequency in seconds.
      # How often these files should be checked for changes. In case it is set
      # to 0s, it is done as often as possible. Default: 10s
      scanFrequency: 10s

      # Defines the buffer size every harvester uses when fetching the file
      harvesterBufferSize: 16384

      # Always tail on log rotation. Disabled by default
      # Note: This may skip entries
      tailOnRotate: false

############################# Shipper ############################################
shipper:

 # The name of the shipper that publishes the network data. It can be used to group
 # all the transactions sent by a single shipper in the web interface.
 # If this options is not defined, the hostname is used.
 name:

 # The tags of the shipper are included in their own field with each
 # transaction published. Tags make it easy to group transactions by different
 # logical properties.
 #tags: ["service1"]

 # Uncomment the following if you want to ignore transactions created
 # by the server on which the shipper is installed. This option is useful
 # to remove duplicates if shippers are installed on multiple servers.
 # ignore_outgoing: true

############################# Output ############################################

# Configure what outputs to use when sending the data collected by filebeat.
# You can enable one or multiple outputs by setting enabled option to true.
output:

  # Elasticsearch as output
  # Options:
  # host, port: where Elasticsearch is listening on
  elasticsearch:
    enabled: true
    hosts: ["localhost:9200"]

  # Redis as output
  # Options:
  # host, port: where Redis is listening on
  #redis:
  #  enabled: true
  #  host: localhost
  #  port: 6379

  # File as output
  # Options:
  # path: where to save the files
  # filename: name of the files
  # rotate_every_kb: maximum size of the files in path
  # number of files: maximum number of files in path
  #file:
  #  enabled: true
  #  path: "/tmp/filebeat"
  #  filename: filebeat
  #  rotate_every_kb: 1000
  #  number_of_files: 7
